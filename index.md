# Frequently asked questions

**Q:** How does STAT 302 differ from MATH 302?

**A:** The two courses are equivalent in terms of the material covered up to some small differences. They are taught by different people, so the assignments, exams, etc are different. In my course, I put an emphasis on applied examples taken from statistics to motivate the theory.

**Q:** There is currently no location for the course shown on SSC.

**A:** SSC has been informed and will address this problem ASAP. **Update:** the location was changed to WOODWARD Room 4. Please verify the information on the day of the first lecture though.
